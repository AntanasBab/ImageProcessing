How many bytes can you index with 16 bits
2^16

Sometimes, you get programs for in “32-bit” vs “64-bit” versions, for
instance operating sysmtems. Why do you think this is?
How many unique memory locations the CPU has

Up to new years eve 1999, people were extrememly concerned about
the so-called Y2K bug. What was the cause of this “bug”?
The expected issue where dates were store in 2 digits and represented 19XX date,
thus 2000 would be represented the same as 1900 as the last two digits are the only
ones to change.

intensity values?
800 * 600 * 8

How many bits are needed to store 800 by 600 pixel RGB image with 8 bits of
intensity levels per channel?
800 * 600 * 8 * 3

How many bytes are needed to store a whole slide image of 12000 by 1600 pixels
with 256 intensity levels (single channel)?
12000 * 1600 * 8 / 8

How many kilobytes are needed to store a whole slide RGB image measuring 32000
by 32000 pixels with 256 intensity levels per color channel?
32000 * 32000 * 8 * 3 / 8 / 1024
