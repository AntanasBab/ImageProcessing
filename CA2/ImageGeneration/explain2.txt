Explanation and Expected Fourier Spectrum Analysis
Constant Image:

Expected Spectrum: Since the image has a single, uniform intensity, the Fourier transform should show a single bright spot at the origin (DC component) and no other frequencies.
Observed Spectrum: We expect to see a single point in the center of the Fourier spectrum, with all other points dark.
Single Frequency Pattern (Horizontal Sine Wave):

Expected Spectrum: A single-frequency sine wave should produce two points symmetric about the center along the frequency axis corresponding to the wave’s orientation. For a horizontal sine wave, these points should be on the horizontal axis.
Observed Spectrum: We expect two bright spots in the horizontal axis of the Fourier spectrum, showing the presence of a single dominant frequency.
Grid Pattern (Checkerboard):

Expected Spectrum: The grid pattern introduces both horizontal and vertical high frequencies, so we expect to see multiple bright spots along both axes, especially at higher frequencies (further from the center).
Observed Spectrum: The Fourier spectrum should reveal bright points arranged symmetrically along both axes, indicating the high-frequency components of the grid.
Random Noise:

Expected Spectrum: Random noise contains all frequencies distributed uniformly, leading to a broad, dense spread in the Fourier spectrum without distinct patterns or symmetry.
Observed Spectrum: We should see a “cloudy” appearance in the Fourier spectrum with random brightness throughout, representing the chaotic frequency components of noise.
Radial Gradient:

Expected Spectrum: A radial gradient contains low frequencies concentrated toward the center and fading outward, so we expect the Fourier spectrum to show a concentration of energy in the center with smooth falloff.
Observed Spectrum: We expect a bright central area in the Fourier spectrum that gradually dims outward, reflecting the low-frequency nature of the radial gradient.
Discussion of Results
Each image's Fourier spectrum should closely match the expected pattern:

Constant images should show only a central DC component, validating the lack of frequency content.
Single-frequency patterns reveal the frequency as distinct spots along the axis of orientation.
Grid patterns confirm the presence of both high-frequency horizontal and vertical components.
Random noise appears as a uniform distribution in the spectrum, representing a mix of frequencies.
Radial gradients confirm the low-frequency content, with brightness concentrated in the center.
By comparing these spectra, we can understand how Fourier transforms capture different frequency characteristics in spatial patterns.
